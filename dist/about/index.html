I'm an applied AI scientist currently building self-driving cars at Wayve. Past includes: AI @ Cruise, Stanford Computer Science B.S./M.S., MLE @ LinkedIn, and water polo.

I am an applied AI scientist at <a href="https://wayve.ai/" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">Wayve</a>, helping the Embodied AI organization develop and deploy <a href="https://wayve.ai/technology/#AV2.0" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">AV2.0</a> technologies. I am particularly interested in how to leverage physical world data to build strong and generalizeable world models to solve the self-driving task.

I spent 5.5 years as an ML Engineer at <a href="https://getcruise.com/" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">Cruise</a>, where I worked on two primary domains: trajectory prediction and trajectory planning. I spent the first couple of years here focused on trajectory prediction. You can see some highlights in this <a href="https://medium.com/cruise/cruise-continuous-learning-machine-30d60f4c691b" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">blog post</a>.
</p> <p class="mt-4">
After that, I transitioned and have been focused on trajectory planning and scoring of AV behavior. We leverage a variety of ML based tools in the supervised learning domains as well as the reinforcement learning domains.

Throughout 2022 and 2023, we deployed a real fleet of autonomous vehicles for a production ridehail service in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin. We have since scaled down our fleet due to the announcements <a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/important-updates-from-cruise/" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">here</a> while we refocus on safe and reliable deployment.

I was an ML Engineer at LinkedIn, where I worked on some of LinkedIn's machine learning infrastructure tooling. I was specifically focused on training tooling to service some of LinkedIn's common data formats and models described in this paper: <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0562-zhangA.pdf" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">GLMix: Generalized Linear Mixed Models For Large-Scale Response Prediction</a>.

Completed my MS in Computer Science following the Artificial Intelligence track. I took several of the very famous Stanford AI/ML courses like CS221, CS224n, CS231n, CS228, etc. Some examples of my class projects include: a rough re-implementation of an IBM published paper on bidirectional attention mechanisms for machine translation (my class project is here: <a href="/cs224n_project.pdf" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">Bifocal Perspectives for Machine Comprehension</a>), as well as a semantic segmentation model for histological breast cancer images (class project is here: <a href="/cs231n_project.pdf" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">Semantic Segmentation with Histological Image Data: Cancer Cell vs. Stroma</a>).

I also was a TA for <a href="https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2023/" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 underline">Percy Liang's CS221 class</a> in the fall of 2016.

Completed my undergraduate BS degree in Computer Science following the Artificial Intelligence track. I took Andrew Ng's seminal course CS229 titled "Introduction to Machine Learning" which sparked my interested in the broad field of AI and neural network based approaches to problem solving.

I also was a 4-year member of the varsity water polo team. I played water polo from a young age, and was lucky enough to compete at the highest collegiate level. I was also selected to play on the youth and junior national teams, which allowed me to compete at various international tournaments across the world.
