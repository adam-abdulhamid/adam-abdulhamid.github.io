---

I have migrated my site from a very simple html/css combination modeled after [karpathy.ai](https://karpathy.ai/) to a more robust static site generator. I am now using [Astro](https://astro.build/) to generate the site with modern tooling and better developer experience.

## What's New

- **Modern Build System**: Using Astro for static site generation
- **Improved Styling**: Tailwind CSS for consistent design
- **Better Organization**: Cleaner file structure and component-based architecture
- **Interactive Features**: Support for client-side components when needed

## What's Coming

I am planning to write about ML related concepts that interest me, largely as a place for me to document my own learnings. The new setup will allow me to:

- Embed interactive demos and visualizations
- Write in markdown with rich formatting
- Organize content better with proper categorization
- Add search and other modern features as needed

The goal is to have a platform that's both easy to write for and engaging to read, while maintaining the clean aesthetic I appreciated about the original simple design.
