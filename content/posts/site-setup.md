I have migrated my site from a very simple html/css combination modeled after [karpathy.ai](https://karpathy.ai/) to a more robust static site generator. I am now using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site, [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) as the theme, and Github Pages to host the site.

I am planning to write about ML related concepts that interset me, largely as a place for me to document my own learning.
