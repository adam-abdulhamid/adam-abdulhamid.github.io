                I am an ML Engineer at <a href="https://getcruise.com/">Cruise</a>, where I have worked on two primary domains: trajectory prediction, and trajectory planning. I spent the first couple of years here focused on trajectory prediction, you can see some highlights in this <a href="https://medium.com/cruise/cruise-continuous-learning-machine-30d60f4c691b">blog post</a>. After that I have been focused on trajectory planning and scoring of AV behavior.

                Throughout 2022/2023 we deployed a real fleet of autonomous vehicles for ridehail in San Francisco, Phoenix and Austin. We have since scaled back due to the announcements <a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/important-updates-from-cruise/">here</a> while we refocus on safe and reliable deployment.

                    I was an ML Engineer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, where I worked on some of LinkedIn's machine learning infrastructure tooling. I was specifically focused on training tooling to service some of LinkedIn's common data formats and models described in this paper: <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0562-zhangA.pdf">GLMix: Generalized Linear Mixed Models For Large-Scale Response Prediction</a>.

                    Completed my MS in Computer Science following the Artificial Intelligence track. I took several of the very famous Stanford AI/ML courses like CS221, CS224n, CS231n, CS228, etc. Some examples of my class projects include: a rough re-implementation of an IBM published paper on bidirectional attention mechanisms for machine translation (my class project is here: <a href="assets/cs224n_project.pdf">Bifocal Perspectives for Machine Comprehension</a>), as well as a semantic segmentation model for histological breast cancer images (class project is here: <a href="assets/cs231n_project.pdf">Semantic Segmentation with Histological Image Data: Cancer Cell vs. Stroma</a>).

                    Completed my undergraduate BS degree in Computer Science following the Artificial Intelligence track. I took Andrew Ng's seminal course CS229 titled "Introduction to Machine Learning" which sparked my interested in the broad field of AI and neural network based approaches to problem solving.

                    I also was a 4-year member of the varsity water polo team. I played water polo from a young age, and was lucky enough to compete at the highest collegiate level. I was also selected to play on the youth and junior national teams, which allowed me to compete at various international tournaments across the world.
